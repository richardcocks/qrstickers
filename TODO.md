# Frontend Integration TODO

## Critical for Production
- [ ] **Export modal implementation** (PNG/SVG, DPI settings, preview, download)

## Designer Features
- [ ] Drag-and-drop from palette
- [ ] Rulers (horizontal and vertical tick marks with unit labels)
- [ ] Image handling in designer (palette display, click-to-add)
- [ ] Fix text data sources
- [ ] Hold right click to pan
- [ ] Reset grab-handles when zooming / resizing page
- [ ] Respect snap to grid on element resize

## Post-Integration
- [ ] Test on staging environment
- [ ] Verify all export scenarios (PNG, SVG, different DPI levels)
- [ ] Performance testing (zoom/pan with large templates, memory usage)
- [ ] Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Delete legacy JavaScript files (`designer.js`, `fabric-extensions.js`, `export-preview.js`)
